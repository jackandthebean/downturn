# Downturn (CMSC 15200 Final Project)
> _The game Downturn was created by a computer science instructor at a prestigious university in the midwestern United States. You may not have heard of it before; it has regrettably remained obscure, and licensing revenue has been profoundly disappointing thus far. In fact, its creator just hopes to be able to use an unsigned int to store the net revenue from the game someday._ â€“ Professor Matthew Wachs

Like Connect Four, players take alternating turns. In a turn, a given player can either drop a piece in one, not-fully-occupied, column; or make one rotation, 90 degrees in either direction.

The objective of the game is to get a number of pieces of your color in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Just like the game board can be different dimensions, the number of pieces in a row required to win is configurable.

The game is made interesting by the fact that the implications of turns and falls may not be obvious to a player, so their opponent may be able to put pieces into positions where they will fall into a line without their opponent realizing and being able to take countermeasures.
